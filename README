In this kata we will write a fluent interfarce for a simple rule engine.

We must implement an API that is capable of doing something as similar as possible to the following:

when_successful ( obj.m() ).then_call ( obj.x() ).as_a_chain()
when_successful ( obj.m() ).then_call ( obj.x(), as_a_chain() )
when_successful ( obj.m() ).then_call ( obj.x() ).with_args(args)

We will consider that a call is successful if it does not throw exceptions.

Of course TDD is mandatory ;)
